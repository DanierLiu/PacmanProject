I was thinking that for other's defensive heuristic, they might
try to implement a way to defend where it alerts when an enemy
comes in right away and where in the board it comes in right away,
so what if we do a double offensive thing where we have one pacman
go in and then another, then pull the second back to defense so it
sort of pulls the defender away from our other "secret spy"
attacker?

I think for the starting point, just as a base thing, we should
implement a thing where if the score is higher theirs, we go defensive
and if not, we'll do once defensive one offensive and work our way
closer to their score one pellet at a time.

Instead of an offense and defense, i say we go flex and defense.

Add a feature for distance to the midpoint, or cutoff/choke point
that is the closest to our character. That way, we cut off intruders
and have an escape route when we are the attackers.


For offense:
We want to go for the closest food and escape the ghosts, if we are closer to a power pellet, we should go for it and wait for the
ghosts to close in on us, meaning if there is a closer food, and the distance to that plus the distance back to the power pellet
is less than the distance between the ghost and the power pellet and the ghost and us added together, then we should go for that.
otherwise, wait around at the power pellet and wait for the ghost to get within 2 and then get the power pellet.
