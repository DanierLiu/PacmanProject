I was thinking that for other's defensive heuristic, they might
try to implement a way to defend where it alerts when an enemy
comes in right away and where in the board it comes in right away,
so what if we do a double offensive thing where we have one pacman
go in and then another, then pull the second back to defense so it
sort of pulls the defender away from our other "secret spy"
attacker?
