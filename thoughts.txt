I was thinking that for other's defensive heuristic, they might
try to implement a way to defend where it alerts when an enemy
comes in right away and where in the board it comes in right away,
so what if we do a double offensive thing where we have one pacman
go in and then another, then pull the second back to defense so it
sort of pulls the defender away from our other "secret spy"
attacker?

I think for the starting point, just as a base thing, we should
implement a thing where if the score is higher theirs, we go defensive
and if not, we'll do once defensive one offensive and work our way
closer to their score one pellet at a time.

Instead of an offense and defense, i say we go flex and defense.
